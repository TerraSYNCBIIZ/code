# CompanyBrain: Personalized AI Employee Assistant - Implementation Plan

## System Overview
A personalized AI business assistant for small team (few users), leveraging existing MCP integrations to provide contextual access to Odoo, Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, and Notes with personal memory storage and recording capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend: Refine Framework
- **Framework**: React-based Refine for rapid CRUD interface development
- **UI**: Material UI or Ant Design for professional employee portal appearance
- **Features**: Role-based dashboards, real-time updates, responsive design
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth providers with RBAC support

### Backend: MCP Integration Layer
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized system connections
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Pipedream MCP for runtime API discovery and loading
- **Core Services**: Node.js/TypeScript backend handling MCP server orchestration

### AI Engine: Claude API Integration
- **Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Anthropic API
- **Context**: Employee-specific context injection based on role and permissions
- **Memory**: Conversation history and company knowledge base integration

## System Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**Technology**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT tokens
**Implementation**:
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with existing company identity provider
- Role-based access control with hierarchical permissions
- Employee profile management with department/team associations

**Roles Structure**:
```
Executive -> Manager -> Employee -> Contractor
        ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓
    All Access  Team+    Personal  Limited
```

### 2. MCP Integration Layer
**Your Existing MCPs**:
- Google Docs, Calendar, Gmail (via Google MCPs)
- Odoo ERP integration
- Pipedream for workflow automation
- Context7 for personal memory storage
- Browser-use for web automation

**New Personal Memory System**:
- Context7 MCP for individual user context storage
- Personal conversation history per employee
- Individual preferences and workflow patterns
- User-specific document and project associations

### 3. Voice & Recording Integration
**Recording Functions**:
- Meeting/call recording via Web Audio API
- Voice commands for system actions
- Automatic transcription and context storage
- Integration with Context7 for personal memory

**Implementation**:
- Browser-use MCP for automated recording setup
- OpenAI Whisper for transcription
- Context7 MCP for storing transcripts per user
- Voice command recognition for common tasks

### 4. Natural Language Processing
**Intent Recognition**: Claude's built-in NLP capabilities
**Action Mapping**: Custom middleware translating natural language to MCP calls
**Context Awareness**: Employee role, current projects, recent activities

**Example Workflows**:
```
Employee: "What did we discuss in yesterday's client call?"
↓ Context7 MCP retrieves personal call transcript
↓ Response: "You discussed pricing changes and Q1 deliverables..."

Employee: "Schedule follow-up with Sarah about the proposal"
↓ Google Calendar MCP + Gmail MCP
↓ Response: "Meeting scheduled, invite sent"

Employee: "Record this call and summarize key points"
↓ Browser-use + Voice recording + Context7 storage
↓ Response: "Recording started, will summarize when complete"
```

### 5. Employee Dashboard Components

**Personal Workspace**:
- Today's calendar with AI-generated meeting prep
- Recent emails requiring action
- Task list from project management systems
- Quick actions based on role

**Company Intelligence**:
- Relevant documents and updates
- Team activity summaries
- System notifications and alerts
- Performance metrics (role-appropriate)

**AI Chat Interface**:
- Context-aware conversation history
- Voice input/output capabilities
- System action buttons ("Take me there")
- File and document sharing

## Implementation Phases

2. **Add natural language processing** for basic actions
3. **Implement voice recording and transcription**
4. **Build action routing system**

### Phase 3: System Connections (4 weeks)
1. **Connect Odoo ERP systems**
2. **Add remaining MCP integrations**
3. **Implement cross-system workflows**
4. **Build memory and knowledge base**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (3 weeks)
1. **Add meeting recording and analysis**
2. **Implement advanced automation workflows**
3. **Build analytics and reporting**
4. **Performance optimization**

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Refine (React-based)
- **UI Library**: Material UI or Ant Design
- **State Management**: React Query (built into Refine)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or similar OAuth provider

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js or Fastify
- **MCP Integration**: Pipedream MCP server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data and logs
- **Caching**: Redis for session and API response caching

### AI & APIs
- **LLM**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic API)
- **Voice**: OpenAI Whisper or AssemblyAI
- **Search**: Vector database for document search (Pinecone/Weaviate)

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean App Platform or AWS/Azure
- **CDN**: CloudFlare for static assets
- **Monitoring**: DataDog or similar APM
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, SOC2 compliance

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
```
Load Balancer (CloudFlare)
├── Frontend (Refine App)
├── API Gateway (Express.js)
├── MCP Orchestrator
├── Claude API Proxy
└── Database Cluster (PostgreSQL + Redis)
```

### Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Zero-trust architecture with per-request authorization
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, request validation, audit logging
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC2, industry-specific requirements

## Estimated Costs (Monthly)

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: $200-500 (based on employee count)
