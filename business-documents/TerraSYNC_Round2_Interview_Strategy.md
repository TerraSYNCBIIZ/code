# 🚀 TerraSYNC Round 2 Interview Strategy
## *"Hire for Passion, Train for Skill"* - Steve Jobs Approach

**Mission**: Find developers who don't just code, but who **think like entrepreneurs** and are passionate about transforming traditional industries through autonomous technology.

---

## 🎯 **The Jobs Framework: 3-Stage Process (18 minutes)**

### **Stage 1: Quick Technical Challenge** *(8 minutes)*
*"Show me how you think, not what you know"*

**Setup**: One focused coding/architecture question based on their role.
*"I care more about how you think than what you know"*

**Choose ONE based on their role** *(Reference: [Husqvarna Automower Connect API](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/apis/automower-connect-api?tab=websocket))*:

**Full-Stack**: *"We're integrating with Husqvarna's Automower Connect API. Design an endpoint that aggregates mower status from their WebSocket feed and triggers alerts for our golf course clients. What's your approach?"*

**Frontend**: *"Build a real-time dashboard using Husqvarna's WebSocket API to show 20 Automower statuses (working, paused, error, etc.). How do you handle the live data stream?"*

**Backend**: *"Design a system that consumes Husqvarna's API data for 1000+ Automowers across multiple golf courses. How do you handle rate limits, authentication, and data persistence?"*

**Mobile**: *"Create a mobile interface for groundskeepers to monitor and control Husqvarna Automowers via their API. What are the key technical challenges?"*

**Look For**: Understanding of API integration, WebSocket handling, real-time data challenges

**Bonus Points If They Consider**:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for Husqvarna API
- WebSocket connection management and reconnection strategies  
- Rate limiting and API quota management
- Handling different mower states (working, paused, error, parked, etc.)
- Time zone handling for scheduling across different golf courses
- Error handling when API is down or mowers go offline

### **Stage 2: Rapid-Fire Character Assessment** *(7 minutes)*
*"A players hire A players, B players hire C players"*

**Quick Questions (Pick 2-3)**:

**Code Quality vs Speed**: *"Perfect code in 3 months or good code that ships in 2 weeks?"*

**Crisis Management**: *"Friday 4PM, client's fleet goes offline during tournament. CTO unreachable. Your move?"*

**Passion Check**: *"Last thing you built for fun outside work?"*

**Communication**: *"Explain a complex technical concept to me in 1 minute."*

**Look For**: Calm thinking, customer focus, genuine passion, clear communication

---

### **Stage 3: Culture & Vision Fit** *(3 minutes)*
*"We need people who think like owners"*

**Final Questions**:
> *"Why do you want to work on autonomous systems?"*
> *"1-10 excitement level for TerraSYNC? What makes it higher?"*

**Red Flag Check**: Do they ask thoughtful questions about the role/tech stack?
