# TerraSYNC Headquarters: Final Property Analysis (v2)

## 1. Executive Summary & Recommendation

This report provides a final, comprehensive analysis of six potential properties for the TerraSYNC headquarters. The evaluation has been updated to reflect a refined scoring framework based on direct feedback, incorporating financial projections and a greater emphasis on cost-effectiveness, location, and leasing potential.

**Key Finding:** After a rigorous re-evaluation, **3501 Tazewell Pike** solidifies its position as the most strategic and financially sound choice for TerraSYNC's headquarters. It offers the best balance of a large, modern building, a usable lot for demonstrations, excellent highway access, and strong leasing potential, all at a highly competitive price point.

**Final Recommendation:**
1.  **Primary Target:** Immediately begin due diligence on **3501 Tazewell Pike**. The combination of features and value is unmatched among the candidates.
2.  **Contingency Plan:** **3224 Meadowrun Ln** remains the backup. Its primary value is the large lot, but this is offset by higher renovation costs and a less strategic location.
3.  **Dismiss:** The other three properties are not recommended as they fail to meet key strategic thresholds in the updated scoring model.

## 2. Revised Scoring Framework

This framework has been updated to reflect refined business priorities.

## 3. Financial Projections: Estimated Monthly Payments

These projections are based on a **9.50% interest rate** (7.50% prime + 2%) business loan over a 20-year term with **100% financing** (no down payment required). This reflects current market conditions with prime rate at 7.50% as of July 2025.

| Property | Asking Price | Down Payment | Loan Amount | **Est. Monthly Payment** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2120 E Magnolia Ave | $375,000 | $0 | $375,000 | **~$3,490** |
| 200 E Inskip Drive | $425,000 | $0 | $425,000 | **~$3,955** |
| 3224 Meadowrun Ln | $499,900 | $0 | $499,900 | **~$4,650** |
| 9044 Middlebrook Pike | $637,500 | $0 | $637,500 | **~$5,933** |
| **3501 Tazewell Pike** | **$650,000** | **$0** | **$650,000** | **~$6,049** |
| 4320 Ball Camp Pike | $744,000 | $0 | $744,000 | **~$6,923** |

**Note on Business Property Financing:** For commercial real estate purchases, businesses typically use SBA 504 loans (offering 10-20% down with competitive rates), conventional business loans, or commercial real estate loans. Your available business loan at prime + 2% (9.50%) is competitive compared to current market rates of 6.6%-11.5% for business loans and 10.5%-15.5% for SBA loans.

## 5. Individual Property Deep Dives (v2)

### 1. 3501 Tazewell Pike (Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 88.0/100**
*   **Summary:** The definitive best choice. It scores highest in the most critical, newly-weighted categories: Cost-Effectiveness, Location, and Leasing Potential. Its proximity to I-640 is excellent, and its large, multi-entrance building is ideal for subleasing. While the monthly payment is higher than some, the value received is by far the greatest.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** A large, modern building with minimal required renovations for the office portion. Excellent price per square foot ($145). High potential to offset mortgage costs through leasing.
    *   **Cost:** The primary cost is the interior renovation for the R&D/warehouse space. The monthly mortgage of ~$6,049 is substantial but manageable and represents a sound investment for a premier property.

### 2. 3224 Meadowrun Ln (Contingency)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 74.0/100**
*   **Summary:** This property's score has decreased with the new framework. Its distance from major highways and lower leasing potential hurt its ranking. It remains the best option *only* if a very large, 1-acre+ demonstration area is deemed absolutely essential, above all other factors.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** The best possible lot for a demonstration area and a lower monthly payment of ~$4,650.
    *   **Cost:** Significant renovation costs are required to make the building functional. The location is less convenient for commuting staff and visiting clients.

### 3. 4320 Ball Camp Pike (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 69.5/100**
*   **Summary:** A great office building with high leasing potential, but it fundamentally fails the "demonstration area" test. Its high price and the highest monthly payment (~$6,923) are not justified for a property that doesn't meet a core business need.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** Excellent highway access and a move-in-ready office.
    *   **Cost:** The lack of a viable demonstration area is a non-starter. The high cost makes it financially inefficient.

### 4. 9044 Middlebrook Pike (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 63.0/100**
*   **Summary:** This property remains a poor value proposition. The high asking price and significant renovation needs result in a low "Cost-Effectiveness" score. The monthly payment of ~$5,933 is too high for a property requiring this much work.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** Good location and a decent lot size.
    *   **Cost:** Inflated price, old buildings, and the complication of an existing tenant.

### 5. 200 E Inskip Drive (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 68.0/100**
*   **Summary:** A solid mid-tier option with good cost-effectiveness and decent highway access via I-75/40. The 1,343 SF office building includes 5 separate offices, full kitchen, and bathrooms. However, the small lot size (0.29 acres) significantly limits demonstration area potential, and the light industrial zoning may restrict future expansion options.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** Reasonable price at $316/sq ft, good office layout with 5 separate offices, existing carport and workshop, convenient interstate access, and current 7.47% cap rate suggests income potential.
    *   **Cost:** Limited demonstration space due to small lot, light industrial zoning restrictions, and relatively small building size may not accommodate future growth.

### 6. 2120 E Magnolia Ave (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 61.3/100**
*   **Summary:** The lowest-cost option with the lowest monthly payment (~$3,490), but it's a one-dimensional property. It serves the need for an R&D/warehouse space well but completely lacks a demonstration area, has minimal office space, and no leasing potential.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** Lowest cost of entry and a building well-suited for industrial R&D.
    *   **Cost:** Fails to meet the strategic need for a client-facing demonstration area, making it unsuitable as a company headquarters.
