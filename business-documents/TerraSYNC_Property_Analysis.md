## 2. TerraSYNC Scoring Framework

To quantify the suitability of each property, we've developed a scoring framework based on TerraSYNC's unique business needs. Each category is weighted based on its strategic importance.

| Category (Weight) | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cost-Effectiveness (25%)** | A comprehensive measure of total value, including asking price, price per square foot, estimated renovation needs, and current property condition. Critical for budget management and ROI. |
| **R&D and Warehouse Space (25%)** | The suitability of the building for hardware testing, repairs, and inventory storage. Requires flexible, open-plan, or easily convertible space, and potentially high ceilings or roll-up doors. |
| **Client Demonstration Area (20%)** | The ability to create a compelling, multi-zone area to showcase TerraSYNC-integrated hardware (mowers, drones, irrigation). Important for sales, plus potential for additional warehouse structures on extra acreage. |
| **Office & Collaboration Space (15%)** | The quality and size of office space for software development, sales, and administrative teams. Doesn't need to be oversized but must be functional. |
| **Location & Highway Access (15%)** | Property accessibility, highway proximity to minimize traffic delays, brand visibility, and proximity to key transport links. Remote locations penalized. |

Each property offers different potential for generating additional revenue through leasing unused space:

| Property | **Lease Potential** | **Estimated Additional Revenue** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3501 Tazewell Pike** | **High** - Large building (4,474 sq ft) allows for subletting office suites or warehouse bays | **$2,000-4,000/month** |
| **3224 Meadowrun Ln** | **Medium** - Small building limits options, but large lot could accommodate additional structures | **$1,000-2,000/month** |

| **2120 E Magnolia Ave** | **Medium** - Industrial space suitable for warehouse/workshop leasing | **$1,500-3,000/month** |

**Lease Revenue Impact on Effective Monthly Costs:**
- **3501 Tazewell Pike:** $5,021/month - $3,000/month (avg lease) = **$2,021/month effective**

## 7. Individual Property Deep Dives

### 1. 3501 Tazewell Pike (Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 84.3/100**
*   **Monthly Loan Payment: $5,021** (effective: $2,021 with lease revenue)
*   **Summary:** The clear winner. It provides a large, modern building with excellent office space and a highly adaptable layout for R&D. The lot is large enough to create a compelling, multi-zone client demonstration area. Its price per square foot is excellent, representing the best overall value. **Highway Access:** Good accessibility without being too remote.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** At $145/sq. ft., this property is a bargain for its size and condition. The recent upgrades (roof, HVAC) significantly lower the near-term operational risk and cost.
    *   **Cost:** The primary cost will be renovating the "residential conversion" interior to create a more open-plan R&D and warehousing space. However, the building's large footprint makes this a manageable task.

### 2. 3224 Meadowrun Ln (Contingency)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 74.3/100**
*   **Monthly Loan Payment: $3,863** (effective: $2,363 with lease revenue)
*   **Summary:** The "perfect lot, imperfect building" option. This property's nearly 1-acre lot is perfectly suited for an expansive, best-in-class client demonstration area. However, the building is the smallest and oldest, requiring the most significant investment to become a functional HQ. **Highway Access:** More remote location reduces convenience for daily commutes.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** The lowest purchase price and largest lot. This combination provides the ultimate blank canvas for a demonstration area.
    *   **Cost:** The building requires a complete gut-and-rebuild of the interior to be suitable for TerraSYNC's needs. The total project cost could approach or even exceed that of the Tazewell Pike property.

### 3. 4320 Ball Camp Pike (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 66.8/100**
*   **Monthly Loan Payment: $5,749** (highest payment, limited lease potential)
*   **Summary:** A great office building that doesn't fit our business. The recently renovated interior and existing lab space are attractive, but the tiny 0.28-acre lot makes a meaningful client demonstration area impossible. **Highway Access:** Excellent location at major intersection.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** The most "move-in ready" office space, potentially lowering initial renovation costs.
    *   **Cost:** The highest asking price and a cripplingly small lot. The inability to build a proper demonstration area is a strategic deal-breaker. The current lease also presents a significant obstacle.

### 4. 2120 E Magnolia Ave (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 66.3/100**
*   **Monthly Loan Payment: $2,897** (lowest payment)
*   **Summary:** A pure industrial space that misses the mark. While the building is well-suited for warehousing and R&D (roll-up door, open space) and the price is the lowest per square foot, the lot is virtually non-existent. **Highway Access:** Reasonable accessibility to major routes.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** The most affordable price per square foot and a building designed for industrial use.
    *   **Cost:** The 0.11-acre lot is entirely insufficient for a client demonstration area, which is a core requirement of the business. The office space would also need to be built out from scratch.

### 5. 9044 Middlebrook Pike (Not Recommended)

*   **TerraSYNC Fit Score: 56.5/100**
*   **Monthly Loan Payment: $4,925**
*   **Summary:** A compromise in all areas. The lot is a good size, but the buildings are old and would require extensive renovation. The asking price is not justified by the property's features. **Highway Access:** Good visibility but overpriced for location benefits.

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
    *   **Benefit:** A flexible two-building setup on a decent-sized lot.
    *   **Cost:** The asking price is inflated compared to its recent sale price and estimated value. The age of the buildings and the complication of the current tenant make this a high-risk, low-reward option.
