### Problem-Solving Ability (5 Points) - **Score: 4/5**

**Speed vs Quality Question:**
> "Define to me what you minimally need for it to do reliably... favor iterative development process... perfect never happens. Google has a bug sheet mile long... done enough within certain tolerances and time schedules"

**Reasoning:** Mature understanding of product development trade-offs, iterative approach

**Crisis Management (4pm Friday, tournament, CTO unreachable):**
> "Communicate to those people... go up the chain... start with the one that's preferred... keep going... try to remediate it internally as fast as possible... communicating with them... what's the most important thing"

**Approach:**
1. Chain of command communication
2. Internal remediation attempts
3. Priority clarification with stakeholders
4. Escalation process

**Strengths:** Systematic approach, communication focus, understands organizational hierarchy

### Cultural Fit Assessment (5 Points) - **Score: 3/5**

**GPS Explanation to 10-year-old:**
> "GPS has something that communicates to a satellite up there in the sky... announcing the position of our car in relationship to a map... ongoing conversation... we're talking about position in relationship to a map or directions"

**Approach:** Clear but somewhat technical, good understanding but could be more creative
**Personal Context:** "I've had 10 year olds, two teenagers right now" - relevant experience

**Ownership Mentality:**
- Strong desire for "seat at the table" and lieutenant role
- Professional approach to disagreements with authority
- Emphasis on advisory role while respecting hierarchy
- Mission alignment focus

**Team Philosophy:**
> "If I disagreed fundamentally then I shouldn't work there... obviously I have not bought into the mission... it's more about process, not about the person"

**Excitement Level:** 9/10 - High enthusiasm with clear path to 10
