# Update on UI/UX Specialist Role

**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**To:** Sumit

## **Dear Sumit,**

I'm writing to personally follow up on our recent final-round interview. First, I want to reiterate how incredibly impressed we were with your skills, your portfolio, and your clear passion for creating world-class user experiences. Your expertise in UI/UX is by far the strongest we have seen.

After much deliberation about our immediate strategic needs, we have made the difficult decision to build out our core backend and IoT infrastructure first before bringing on a dedicated design specialist. For that reason, we will not be extending an offer for a UI/UX role at this exact moment.

However, I want to be extremely clear: **this is a "not now" decision, not a "no".**

You are our definitive first choice for this role. We were so impressed that we have decided to build our initial team and then bring you on as our first design-focused hire as soon as our foundational architecture is in place. We don't want to look for anyone else.

We anticipate needing to fill this role in the near future, likely within the next few months. We would be honored if you would allow us to keep in touch and contact you first when we are ready to move forward.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your incredible work with us. We hope to have the opportunity to work with you very soon.

**Sincerely,**

**Wesley Pitts**
