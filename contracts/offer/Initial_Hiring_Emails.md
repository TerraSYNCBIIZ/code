## **Email 4: Communication with Sumit (Future Role)**

**Subject:** Following Up on our Interview at TerraSYNC

**Body:**

Dear Sumit,

I'm writing to personally follow up on our final interview. I want to start by saying again how incredibly impressed we were with your portfolio and your clear passion for creating world-class user experiences. Your expertise is by far the strongest we have seen.

This made our final decision very difficult. After mapping out our immediate strategic needs, we've decided to build out our core backend and IoT infrastructure first before bringing on a dedicated design specialist. For that reason, we wonâ€™t be moving forward with a UI/UX offer at this exact moment.

However, I want to be extremely clear: this is a "not now" decision, not a "no." You are our definitive first choice for this role, and we would like to bring you on as our first design hire as soon as our foundational architecture is in place.

We anticipate this happening in the near future and would be honored if you would allow us to keep in touch and contact you first when we're ready.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your incredible work with us. We hope to speak again very soon.

Best regards,

Wesley Pitts  
Founder, KnoxBots LLC (DBA TerraSYNC)
