### 4. What is the breakdown of profits and how are they distributed?

The profits from the Palm Beach location are split **40/60**.

*   **40%** of the net profits go to **Jet and Alex**.
*   **60%** of the net profits go to the **Parent Company** (TerraSYNC).

The 40% share is distributed to the Managers as a single, collective payment. They are responsible for dividing it between themselves.

> **From the Contract (Section IV, Profit Distribution):**
> *"40% of the net profits generated by the Location will be distributed collectively to the Managers. 60% of the net profits will be distributed to TerraSYNC. The internal division of the 40% profit share between the Managers is their own responsibility..."*

### 5. Is there any other compensation?

Yes. To provide stability during the startup phase, the Managers receive a collective **$3,000 monthly Management Fee.** This is a guaranteed payment treated as a business expense.

This fee stops permanently once their 40% profit share is consistently greater than the fee.

> **From the Contract (Section XIV, Manager Compensation):**
> *"the Managers shall receive a collective monthly Management Fee of $3,000... This Management Fee shall cease permanently once the Managers' collective 40% monthly profit share distribution has exceeded $3,000 for three consecutive months."*
