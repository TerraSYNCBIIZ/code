# TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC Operating Agreement

## I. Definitions and Formation

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:

**Capital Contributions:** The total monetary or asset-based investment made by the Managers into the Company, including both initial and any subsequent contributions. These contributions determine the Managers' vested equity, subject to the vesting schedule outlined in this Agreement. Additional capital contributions beyond the initial investment may be required under specific circumstances, as outlined in the Capital Calls section of this Agreement.

**Net Profits:** The remaining income after all operating expenses, taxes, recurring capital expenditures, and any other liabilities have been deducted. One-time capital investments shall not be deducted from net profits for distribution purposes. Net Profits shall be calculated according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and used to determine distributions to the Managers and TerraSYNC.

**Major Decisions:** Business decisions that materially affect the financial stability, strategic direction, legal compliance, or operational capacity of the Company, including but not limited to:
- Any capital expenditure exceeding $10,000 in a single transaction.
- Changes to service offerings or business models.
- Entering into or modifying long-term contracts, leases, or financial obligations exceeding 12 months.
- Hiring or terminating key personnel outside of normal operational roles.
- Any decision that creates significant legal exposure or compliance risk for the Company.

**Indemnification:** The protection of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC and its Managers against financial liability for actions taken in good faith within the scope of their duties. Managers shall not be personally liable for Company debts unless fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct is proven. If legal action arises against a Manager due to Company-related activities, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall cover reasonable legal defense costs unless the Manager is found to have acted outside their authority or in bad faith.

**Veto Power:** The authority retained by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC to block or override decisions made by the Managers in cases where a decision may pose a significant risk to the Company, materially alter its financial health, or disrupt its strategic direction. If exercised, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC must provide a written explanation within five (5) business days detailing the rationale for the veto and, if applicable, an alternative course of action.

**Cause (for Manager Expulsion):** Grounds for the removal of a Manager include, but are not limited to:
- Gross negligence or misconduct.
- Failure to fulfill financial obligations or capital contribution commitments.
- Any criminal activity related to business operations.
- Repeated violations of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's policies or operational procedures that materially harm business operations.
- Actions that materially harm KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's business, reputation, or legal standing.

### Formation and Purpose
(a) **Entity Formation:** TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC (the "Company") is a Limited Liability Company (LLC) duly formed and existing under the laws of the State of Florida. KnoxBots LLC, operating under the DBA "TerraSYNC" (hereinafter referred to as "TerraSYNC" or "KnoxBots"), is the sole member and holds 100% ownership interest in the Company. Upon incorporation of TerraSYNC Corporation, all rights, obligations, and ownership interests referenced herein shall transfer to TerraSYNC Corporation. KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may, at its discretion, establish subsidiaries or affiliate entities to support its strategic objectives, provided that such entities do not alter the rights or obligations of the Managers under this Agreement.

(b) **Purpose:** The Company is established to operate and manage a specific business location in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Location"). The Company's business activities include but are not limited to:
- Providing robotic grounds maintenance automation services and related technology solutions.
- Managing operations, customer service, and financial management for the Palm Beach Location.
- Ensuring compliance with all KnoxBots/TerraSYNC operational policies, regulatory requirements, and quality standards.
- Engaging in any additional business activities approved by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC that align with its overall strategic objectives, including expansions into new service offerings or markets.

The Company shall be managed by Jet Tickle and Alex Koenig (collectively referred to as the "Managers"). The Managers shall be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Location, subject to the oversight and ultimate authority of KnoxBots LLC/TerraSYNC.

### Corporate Structure Transition
All references to "TerraSYNC LLC" in this Agreement shall apply to KnoxBots LLC until such time as TerraSYNC Corporation is incorporated. Upon incorporation of TerraSYNC Corporation, all rights, obligations, equity interests, and authority referenced herein shall automatically transfer to TerraSYNC Corporation without requiring amendment to this Agreement. The Managers' 1% equity interest shall remain in the parent entity, whether KnoxBots LLC or TerraSYNC Corporation post-incorporation.

## II. Ownership Structure and Membership Interests

KnoxBots LLC ("TerraSYNC" or "KnoxBots") is the sole member of TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC, holding 100% ownership interest in the Company. Upon incorporation, TerraSYNC Corporation shall become the sole member. KnoxBots/TerraSYNC reserves the right to sell, transfer, or restructure its ownership interest in the Company at its discretion, provided that any such action does not affect the contractual rights and obligations of the Managers under this Agreement.

TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC is recognized as the first location under the KnoxBots/TerraSYNC structure and is designated as "Location Number One."

The Managers of Location Number One, Jet Tickle and Alex Koenig, are participants in Tier One of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's equity structure.

10% total equity of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC is reserved exclusively for the first 1-10 locations under the expansion plan. Each Tier One location is allocated 1% non-dilutive equity, which is subject to a three-year vesting period as outlined in this Agreement. Equity is tied to the location, meaning that ownership cannot be transferred outside of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC without express approval.

As long as KnoxBots/TerraSYNC has 1-10 locations, each Tier One location is allocated 1% non-dilutive equity. This equity shall remain non-dilutive, regardless of future expansion, investment, capital restructuring, or corporate growth beyond 10 locations. The equity allocated to Tier One locations cannot be reduced, diluted, or otherwise modified without the written consent of the affected Tier One Managers.

Tier One locations receive priority benefits, including:
- **Right of First Refusal:** In the event of equity sales or new investment opportunities, Tier One locations shall have the first opportunity to purchase equity before lower-tier locations.
- **Priority Payouts:** In the event of an acquisition, dividend distribution, or liquidity event, Tier One locations receive payouts before lower-tier locations.
- **Exclusive Voting Rights on Major Decisions:** Tier One locations maintain a higher level of governance rights within KnoxBots/TerraSYNC, including priority voting on strategic expansions, mergers, and corporate restructuring.

The 1% equity in KnoxBots/TerraSYNC allocated to the Location is granted to Jet Tickle and Alex Koenig collectively as a single, unified interest. The specific internal division of this equity between the two Managers is their private responsibility. In the event of a disagreement between the Managers regarding the equity, they must resolve it between themselves. All actions related to the equity (such as voting or selling) must be presented to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC as a single, joint decision.

If one Manager exits the Company, their portion of the collective vested equity must first be offered to the remaining Manager. If the remaining Manager declines to purchase it, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall have the right of first refusal to buy that portion at fair market value before it can be offered to an external party. Any external buyer must be approved by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. The determination of what constitutes an exiting Manager's "portion" is a matter to be resolved privately between the two Managers.

Managers must remain active for three (3) years to fully vest their 1% non-dilutive equity stake within KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. Vesting occurs at the location level, meaning that a Manager must be actively managing a Tier One location to earn vested equity.

Prior to full vesting, the Managers shall have:
- The right to participate in strategic discussions related to the Company's future direction.
- The right to vote on major operational matters, but voting weight shall be proportional to the vested equity held at the time of the vote.

If a Manager voluntarily exits or is removed for cause prior to full vesting, they forfeit all unvested equity. If a Manager leaves in good standing, they shall receive a prorated payout, calculated as follows:
- 0-12 months of service = No payout; full forfeiture.
- 12-24 months of service = 25% "Good Standing Payout" (calculated at fair market value of their unvested equity).
- 24-36 months of service = 50% "Good Standing Payout" (calculated at fair market value of their unvested equity).
- 36+ months = Full ownership of vested equity.

If a Manager leaves due to medical incapacity, death, or a company-approved exit, their vested equity may be transferred to an approved beneficiary or bought out by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC at fair market value.

Once fully vested, the Manager's equity may not be transferred or sold to any third party without the written approval of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right of first refusal on any sale or transfer of vested equity.

## III. Capital Investment Conversion and Banking System Integration

### Capital Investment Transition
Within twelve (12) months of this Agreement, the Managers' separate operating account shall be integrated into TerraSYNC's centralized banking system. Upon this integration:

The Managers' initial $100,000 capital contribution shall be considered fully deployed for equity and profit-sharing purposes, regardless of the amount actually spent at the time of integration.

Any remaining capital from the Managers' initial investment becomes TerraSYNC operational capital and is no longer subject to refund or distribution rights.

All Location revenue and expenses shall flow through TerraSYNC's centralized banking system with appropriate sub-account allocation for transparency and reporting.

Post-integration, the Managers' investment shall be considered complete, and their equity rights shall be based solely on the vesting schedule outlined in this Agreement.

### Banking System Structure
The Company shall operate under TerraSYNC's centralized banking system with dedicated sub-account allocation for the Palm Beach Location. All client payments, operational expenses, and profit distributions shall flow through this centralized system to ensure proper accounting, tax compliance, and financial transparency.

## IV. Profit Distribution

Net Profits shall be calculated as the total revenue of the Company minus all operating expenses, taxes, debt obligations, and any other liabilities, including reserves for future business needs, capital expenditures, and reinvestment requirements as determined by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. Any such reserves must be determined in good faith, be commercially reasonable, and be clearly documented and explained in the Company's quarterly financial reports.

Capital contributions shall not be included in the calculation of Net Profits for distribution purposes. However, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may determine whether capital contributions may be repaid separately from Net Profit distributions, subject to financial stability and liquidity conditions.

Profit distributions shall only be made to active Managers currently engaged in the operations of the Company. If a Manager exits voluntarily or is terminated for cause, they forfeit any right to future profit distributions beyond the date of termination.

40% of the net profits generated by the Location will be distributed collectively to the Managers. 60% of the net profits will be distributed to TerraSYNC. The internal division of the 40% profit share between the Managers is their own responsibility and will not be managed or mediated by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

Profit distributions shall be made on a monthly basis unless otherwise determined by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC due to financial or operational considerations.

Managers have the option to reinvest their profits into the investor's portion of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC, which accounts for 19% of the Company. Reinvested funds do not directly increase ownership percentage unless separately negotiated, but they shall be recorded as retained earnings and may be subject to future valuation-based equity adjustments at the discretion of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

## V. Capital Calls

Should the Company require additional capital for operational needs, expansion, or to cover financial shortfalls, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may initiate a capital call.

1.  **Notice of Capital Call:** KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall provide the Managers with a formal written notice detailing the total amount of capital required and the business justification for the need.

2.  **Manager Participation (Optional):** The Managers shall have the option, but not the obligation, to contribute capital to meet this requirement.

3.  **Dilution for Non-Participation:** If the Managers decline to contribute, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC will provide the full amount of required capital. In such an event, the Managers' 1% equity stake in the parent company (KnoxBots LLC/TerraSYNC Corporation) may be subject to dilution. The dilution will be calculated based on a pre-money valuation of the parent company at the time of the capital call and the amount of new capital invested, ensuring that the ownership percentage of all parties accurately reflects their total capital invested.

## VI. Voting Rights and Decision-Making Processes

The Managers shall have voting rights on operational matters at the Location level, except for those decisions reserved for KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's veto power.

For day-to-day operational decisions, a majority vote of the Managers is required. In the event of a tie, the Managers shall engage in an internal resolution process for up to three (3) business days. TerraSYNC may intervene and make the final decision at any point during this period or immediately if the matter requires urgent resolution.

The Managers shall handle all routine operational decisions necessary for the continued function of the Location. However, any decision involving a material change to the business model, financial commitments exceeding $10,000, or legal matters affecting the Company shall require approval from KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may exercise its veto power only in cases where a Managerial decision directly affects financial commitments, strategic direction, legal exposure, or operational sustainability. Day-to-day operational decisions shall not be subject to veto power unless they meet these criteria. If exercised, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall provide a written justification within five (5) business days.

If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC misuses its veto power in a way that results in unnecessary operational delays or financial harm to the Location, the Managers may submit a formal dispute under the following process:
- The Managers shall submit a formal request for reconsideration, outlining the operational harm caused by the veto.
- KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall have ten (10) business days to respond and either:
  - Provide a written justification for the decision, or
  - Reverse the veto decision.
- If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's veto decision causes operational delays exceeding thirty (30) business days and results in verifiable financial harm to the Location, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall be responsible for covering operational losses directly attributed to the delay, based on documented financial impact.

If the Managers believe a veto decision is being applied unfairly, they may formally dispute the decision through the following steps:
- **Written Appeal:** Managers must submit an appeal to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC within seven (7) days of the veto decision.
- **Internal Review:** KnoxBots/TerraSYNC has fourteen (14) days to review and either uphold or reverse the decision.
- **Final Resolution:** If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC upholds the veto, the Managers may escalate the dispute to mediation or arbitration under Section XXI.

## VII. Procedures for Appointing New Managers or Transferring Managerial Roles

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the exclusive right to appoint new Managers to TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC but must provide written notice to the existing Managers at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed appointment. If the existing Managers unanimously object in writing, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall be required to provide justification for the appointment and hold a formal review discussion before proceeding.

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC maintains the right of refusal to appoint new Managers unless the appointment is in accordance with pre-existing agreements or succession planning. The appointment of a new Manager would typically occur in the event of a leadership transition, resignation, or operational expansion, and all such appointments shall be communicated thoroughly with the existing Managers.

Managers may not transfer their managerial role or delegate their authority to another party without the prior written consent of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

If a Manager voluntarily exits, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall be obligated to either:
- Appoint a replacement Manager within ninety (90) days, or
- Approve a qualified successor proposed by the departing Manager, provided the successor meets KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's eligibility requirements.

If a Manager wishes to step down but intends to transfer their managerial duties to another individual, the following process applies:
- The remaining Manager shall have the first option to assume the responsibilities of the departing Manager, subject to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's approval.
- If the remaining Manager declines to take on the additional role, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall have the authority to appoint a new Manager or approve a qualified successor.
- If neither the remaining Manager nor KnoxBots/TerraSYNC elects to appoint a replacement, the departing Manager may nominate a successor, but final approval shall remain at the sole discretion of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

In the event of a dispute over managerial transfers, the matter shall be resolved under the Deadlock Resolution Process (Section XXI).

## VIII. Dissolution Procedures

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the exclusive right to dissolve TerraSYNC Palm Beach LLC or the parent company as a whole under the following conditions:
- If the Location or Company fails to meet agreed-upon performance standards,
- If the Location or Company is financially insolvent,
- If dissolution is necessary due to legal, financial, or strategic reasons, or
- At the sole discretion of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC, particularly if the business model is no longer viable.

### Dissolution of an Individual Location

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may dissolve an individual location if it underperforms, without affecting the overall Company structure. The dissolution of a single location does not impact the vested equity of Managers in other locations, nor does it affect the operations of remaining locations.

If an individual location is dissolved, the Managers may:
- Be reallocated to the nearest TerraSYNC location, subject to operational needs and approval by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.
- Be offered the opportunity to start a new location, subject to new contractual agreements.

- **Capital Investment** – The Managers' initial $100,000 capital contribution shall be considered fully deployed and is not subject to refund upon dissolution, as outlined in Section III.
- **Asset Retention** – Any physical or digital assets purchased using the initial investment funds and essential to the Manager's future operations may be transferred to the Manager at depreciated book value, subject to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's approval.

- **Financial Insolvency Clause** – If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC is financially insolvent at the time of dissolution, vested equity holders may receive little to no payout due to a lack of remaining company value. Managers shall not be entitled to additional compensation beyond what is available through liquidation.

## IX. Equity Vesting Schedule

### Vesting Period & Milestones

Managers participating in Tier One receive a 1% non-dilutive equity stake in KnoxBots/TerraSYNC, subject to a three-year vesting schedule based on the following milestones:
- 12 months completed – 25% vested equity
- 24 months completed – 50% vested equity
- 36 months completed – 100% fully vested equity

Equity vests on an annual basis, meaning Managers must complete each milestone period before earning the next portion of vested equity. Partial-year vesting does not apply; if a Manager exits before reaching a milestone, they forfeit the next vesting percentage.

### Payout Structure for Vested Equity

Once a Manager's equity is fully vested, their payout shall be issued through one of the following methods:

**24-Month Installment Plan (Default Payout Method)**
- Managers shall receive their vested equity payout in equal quarterly installments over a 24-month period.
- Payments shall be based on the company's valuation at the time of payout initiation.
- If TerraSYNC undergoes a significant valuation event, including but not limited to a sale, major investment, or restructuring, the installment payout amount shall be reassessed at fair market value.
- Installments shall be paid in cash or other agreed-upon assets unless otherwise determined by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

**Accelerated Lump-Sum Payout (At Discounted Rate)**
- A Manager may elect to receive a lump-sum buyout of their vested equity at a discounted rate, determined by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.
- The discount applied to a lump-sum buyout shall be between 10% and 30%, based on liquidity conditions and market valuation.
- Lump-sum payments shall be made within 90 days of agreement execution.
- KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right to approve or deny lump-sum requests based on financial conditions. If a lump-sum buyout is declined, the Manager must remain on the 24-month installment plan.

### Equity Treatment Upon Early Exit

If a Manager exits before full vesting, the following rules apply:
- 0-12 months served – no equity payout, full forfeiture of unvested shares
- 12-24 months served – 25% equity payout based on company valuation
- 24-36 months served – 50% equity payout based on company valuation
- 36+ months served – full 1% equity payout based on company valuation

Managers who exit early forfeit all unvested equity.

If a Manager exits voluntarily and in good standing, they may:
- Receive their vested equity payout over a 24-month installment plan
- Elect an accelerated lump sum at a discounted rate, subject to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's approval

If a Manager is removed for cause, their vested equity payout shall be subject to review, and KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right to withhold payment or buy back the equity at a reduced rate.

### Equity Treatment in a Company-Wide Dissolution

If the parent company is dissolved before a Manager reaches full vesting, their equity payout shall be calculated as follows:
- Managers retain the vested portion of their equity in accordance with the vesting schedule.
- Unvested equity is forfeited and does not count toward any liquidation payout.
- Final payout is based on the company's liquidation value at the time of dissolution.
- If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC is insolvent, no payout shall be guaranteed, regardless of vesting status.

### Transferability of Vested Equity

- Once fully vested, a Manager's equity may not be sold or transferred to a third party without KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's written approval.
- KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right of first refusal to buy vested equity before it is sold externally.
- If a Manager elects to sell their vested equity, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC has 30 days to match the highest offer made by a third party.
- If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC declines, the equity may only be transferred to a qualified buyer approved by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

### Post-Vesting Buyout Option

If a vested Manager wishes to cash out their equity, they may:
- Request a full buyout from KnoxBots/TerraSYNC at fair market value, subject to company liquidity
- Sell their equity to an approved third party under the right of first refusal
- Hold their equity indefinitely and continue receiving profit distributions based on ownership share

If a Manager elects a buyout, payment shall be made in quarterly installments over 24 months unless otherwise negotiated.

## X. Books, Records, and Financial Audits

The Company shall maintain accurate and complete books and records of all financial transactions. KnoxBots/TerraSYNC will assist the Managers in this process, particularly as the Company scales.

### Financial Records Maintenance

The Company shall maintain the following financial statements and records:
- Income statements

- Records of all relevant financial transactions

All financial records shall be maintained for a minimum of five (5) years from the date of the transaction, in compliance with state and federal regulations.

### Financial Audits

The Company shall undergo an independent financial audit at least once every two (2) years, unless otherwise determined by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. The cost of such audits shall be covered by the Company.

## XI. Insurance Requirements

### General Liability & Additional Coverage

The Company shall maintain comprehensive general liability insurance with a minimum coverage amount of $2,000,000 per occurrence. Additional insurance policies, including but not limited to workers' compensation, commercial auto insurance, cyber liability, and property insurance, shall be obtained as needed based on Company operations and regulatory requirements.

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right to select and change insurance providers at its sole discretion.

### Payment of Insurance Premiums

All general liability, property, and operational insurance costs shall be covered by the Company.

Any individual insurance policies required for Managers beyond the Company's standard coverage shall be the responsibility of the respective Manager unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

### Annual Insurance Review

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall conduct an annual insurance review to determine whether additional coverage is necessary. Any required modifications or additional policies shall be implemented upon a written determination by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC.

### Indemnification

Managers shall be indemnified against liabilities, losses, or damages incurred while performing their duties, provided they acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.

Indemnification shall include legal defense costs, settlements, and judgments arising from claims related to the Manager's official duties, provided that the Manager acted in good faith and within the scope of their authority. Managers found to have engaged in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct shall not be entitled to indemnification.

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall also be indemnified against actions taken by the Managers outside the scope of their authority or in violation of this Agreement.

## XII. Reinvestment of Profits

### Reinvestment Option

Managers have the option to reinvest a portion of their profits into KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's investor's portion, which accounts for 19% of the Company. The internal valuation for such reinvestment shall be transparent to all location owners.

### Valuation & Conversion Rate for Reinvestment

Reinvested profits shall be converted into additional investment value based on the most recent internal valuation of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC at the time of reinvestment. The valuation shall be determined using the following methods:

**If a formal company valuation exists (e.g., after investment rounds or financial audits):**
- The reinvestment shall be converted based on the latest assessed company valuation.

**If no formal valuation is available:**
- The reinvestment shall be calculated using a standard multiple of the Company's 12-month trailing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).
- The standard multiple shall be set at 5x EBITDA, unless otherwise adjusted by the Leadership Team of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC based on industry conditions and financial strategy.

**If a Manager elects to reinvest at a time when no valuation event has occurred:**
- The reinvestment conversion rate shall default to the most recent valuation performed within the last 12 months.
- If no such valuation exists, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall provide a reasonable valuation estimate, subject to financial review and approval.

### Right to Deny Reinvestment

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the sole right to approve or deny reinvestment requests based on financial conditions, strategic priorities, and operational needs. Any reinvestment request may be denied if:
- The reinvestment would exceed the Company's planned capital structure.
- The funds are not required for expansion, operational improvements, or debt reduction.
- The reinvestment conflicts with KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's financial or strategic planning.

All reinvestment elections must be submitted in writing and approved by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC before the funds are allocated.

### Ownership Impact of Reinvestment

Reinvested profits shall be recorded as retained earnings and may be subject to future valuation-based equity adjustments at the discretion of KnoxBots/TerraSYNC. However, reinvestment does not automatically increase the Manager's ownership percentage unless a separate equity issuance agreement is executed.

### Reinvestment Frequency & Election Process

Managers may elect to reinvest a portion of their profits on a quarterly or annual basis. All reinvestment elections must be submitted in writing and approved by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC before the funds are allocated.

### Impact on Profit Distributions

Managers who elect to reinvest profits shall have the reinvested amount deducted from their monthly distribution payments. Reinvestments shall be recorded separately from standard profit distributions to ensure transparency in financial reporting.

## XIII. Manager Withdrawal and Expulsion

### Voluntary Withdrawal

If a Manager wishes to withdraw from the Company, they must provide written notice to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC at least 90 days in advance.

The withdrawing Manager's equity shall be valued based on the most recent internal company valuation, determined using a multiple of 5x EBITDA or the last formal external valuation, whichever is more recent.

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall have the first right to purchase the equity at this valuation.

If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC declines to purchase the equity, the Manager may sell to a qualified third-party buyer, subject to KnoxBots/TerraSYNC's right of first refusal.

Any buyout by KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall be paid over a 24-month installment plan, unless a lump-sum payment is mutually agreed upon.

### Manager Expulsion Process

A Manager may be removed for Cause, which includes but is not limited to:
- Gross negligence, misconduct, or criminal activity related to business operations.
- Failure to fulfill financial obligations or meet capital contribution commitments.
- Repeated violations of company policies or failure to meet operational expectations.

**Streamlined Expulsion Process:**
- **Written Notice:** KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall provide written notice stating the specific reasons for removal.
- **Right to Respond:** The Manager has 5 business days to submit a written response addressing the allegations.
- **Final Decision:** KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains sole authority to make the final expulsion decision based on the Manager's response and business needs.
- **Immediate Effect:** Upon expulsion, the Manager must immediately relinquish all operational control, intellectual property rights, and business assets.

**Financial Settlement Upon Expulsion:**
- The Manager's vested equity shall be purchased at fair market value based on the most recent valuation.
- Buyouts shall be paid over a 24-month installment plan.
- Capital contributions are not subject to return as outlined in Section III.
- KnoxBots/TerraSYNC may, at its discretion, accelerate payment timelines or adjust settlement terms based on the circumstances of expulsion.

## XIV. Manager Compensation, Performance Bonuses, and Performance Standards

### Manager Compensation
In recognition of their foundational efforts during the initial setup and growth phases, the Managers shall receive a collective monthly Management Fee of $3,000. This fee is a guaranteed payment, treated as a standard operating expense of the Company, and is intended to provide a stable baseline income before the Location generates significant profits.

This Management Fee shall cease permanently once the Managers' collective 40% monthly profit share distribution has exceeded $3,000 for three consecutive months. Following the cessation of the fee, the Managers' sole compensation will be their 40% share of Net Profits and any applicable performance bonuses.

### Performance Bonuses

If the Managers exceed their annual managed acreage growth targets during the Growth Phase (2026-2030), they are eligible for a performance bonus that increases their net profit distribution up to 50%.

**Bonus Trigger Thresholds:**
- **2026:** Exceeding 150 acres triggers bonus eligibility
- **2027:** Exceeding 300 total acres (150 additional) triggers bonus eligibility  
- **2028:** Exceeding 500 total acres (200 additional) triggers bonus eligibility
- **2029+:** Exceeding 15% annual growth triggers bonus eligibility

The bonus applies for the remainder of the year in which the growth target is exceeded.
- Example 1: If the growth goal is exceeded in month 10, the bonus applies from month 10 through month 12.
- Example 2: If the target is met in month 2, the bonus applies from month 2 through month 12.

No performance bonuses are available during the 2025 Setup Year, as this period focuses on operational establishment rather than aggressive growth targets.

### Financial & Operational Performance Benchmarks

Managers are expected to meet the following managed acreage growth benchmarks on a quarterly and annual basis:

**Setup & Launch Phase:**
- **2025 (Setup Year):** Establish operational systems, complete equipment deployment, and secure initial client base. Minimum expectation: 3+ active service contracts and operational readiness for scale.

**Growth Phase:**
- **2026 (Year 1):** Minimum 150 acres under management
- **2027 (Year 2):** Additional 150 acres under management (Total: 300 acres)  
- **2028 (Year 3):** Additional 200 acres under management (Total: 500 acres)

**Post-Year 3 Growth Expectations (2029 & Beyond):**
- Minimum 15% increase in managed acreage per year
- Expansion into at least one new operational territory within five years
- Customer base growth of at least 20% per year
- Operational efficiency improvement of at least 10% per year

Failure to meet managed acreage benchmarks for two consecutive quarters after the Setup Year shall trigger a performance review and may result in probation, corrective action, or expulsion. During the Setup Year, performance shall be evaluated based on operational milestones and client acquisition progress rather than strict acreage targets.

### Operational Performance Benchmarks

Managers are responsible for ensuring that the Location meets the following operational standards:
- **Service Delivery Standards** – The Location must meet or exceed 95% on-time service completion rates for client obligations.
- **Customer Satisfaction Scores** – The Location must maintain an average customer satisfaction rating of 4.0/5 or higher, based on collected reviews and client feedback.
- **Employee Management & Retention** – The Location must maintain a minimum 80% employee retention rate among key personnel over a rolling 12-month period.
- **Regulatory & Compliance Standards** – The Location must remain in full compliance with state and federal regulations, industry safety standards, and KnoxBots/TerraSYNC operational policies.
- **Operational Efficiency & Reporting** – The Manager must submit all required financial and operational reports on time each quarter, with no more than one late submission in a 12-month period.

Failure to meet these operational benchmarks for two consecutive quarters shall trigger a performance review and may result in probation, corrective action, or expulsion.

### Performance Review & Corrective Action

If a Manager fails to meet financial or operational performance benchmarks for two consecutive quarters, the following steps shall be taken:
- **First Review Meeting** – A formal review shall be conducted with TerraSYNC leadership to assess the cause of underperformance and determine necessary corrective actions.
- **Probation Period** – If performance benchmarks continue to be unmet for a third consecutive quarter, the Manager may be placed on probation for an additional quarter with specific performance improvement goals outlined.
- **Expulsion Consideration** – If the Manager fails to meet performance benchmarks for four consecutive quarters, they may be subject to removal under the expulsion process outlined in Section XIII.

### Adjustment of Performance Benchmarks

KnoxBots/TerraSYNC retains the right to adjust financial and operational benchmarks on an annual basis to reflect economic conditions, industry trends, and business model shifts. Any changes shall be communicated in writing to all Managers at least 30 days before implementation.

## XV. Succession Planning

### Succession Procedure

If a Manager can no longer fulfill their role due to resignation, incapacitation, or death, the following succession process applies:

If no valid succession plan exists, KnoxBots/TerraSYNC shall have the right of first refusal to purchase the equity before it is transferred to an external party.

If KnoxBots/TerraSYNC elects to purchase the equity, the buyout shall be executed at the most recent valuation, using a multiple of 5x EBITDA or the last formal external valuation, whichever is more recent.

Payments shall be made over a 24-month installment period, unless a lump-sum buyout is mutually agreed upon.
