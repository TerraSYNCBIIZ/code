## 2. SCOPE OF SERVICES

2.1 **Equipment Ownership**: The Client purchases and owns all Equipment outright as specified in Exhibit A (or relevant purchase documentation).

2.2 **Maintain Me Service Plan**: KNOXBOTS agrees to provide ongoing support and service ("Maintain Me") during the Covered Replacement & Service Period under the following terms:
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** This plan is designed to provide comprehensive operational support. Subject to the terms herein, KNOXBOTS covers Standard Service Labor and replacement parts due to Manufacturer Defects or Normal Wear and Tear for the duration of the Covered Replacement & Service Period.
- **Scheduled Routine Upkeep:** KNOXBOTS will perform Routine Upkeep, including:
  - Scheduled blade replacements according to the Client's service tier (e.g., Athletic, Pro, Residential, as potentially detailed in Exhibit C).
  - Concurrent system checkups following KNOXBOTS' standard checklist during scheduled visits.

2.5 **Future Equipment or Acreage Additions/Removals**: If the Client adds or removes mowable acreage or adds Equipment units requiring service under this Contract, the Monthly Service Fee shall be recalculated according to the rates in Section 4.2. Installation Fees for *new* scope (additional acreage or units beyond the initial setup) are outside the scope of this Service Contract and will be quoted separately based on KNOXBOTS' then-current standard rates.

## 26. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All software, firmware, trademarks, designs, and related intellectual property rights associated with the Equipment or KNOXBOTS' services remain the exclusive property of KNOXBOTS or the respective manufacturers. The Client only obtains ownership of the physical Equipment itself.

Any required notices shall be in writing and delivered (i) personally, (ii) via certified mail, (iii) by recognized courier, or (iv) by email (with a follow-up confirmation) to the addresses designated by each Party. Notices are effective upon confirmed delivery or refusal.

## 32. OWNERSHIP AND RETURN OF EQUIPMENT

Since the Client purchases the Equipment, no return is required at Contract's end. However, if the Client wishes to upgrade, trade-in, or sell back the Equipment, those transactions must be separately negotiated with KNOXBOTS or an authorized reseller.

## 33. PERFORMANCE REVIEWS

KNOXBOTS will periodically review performance with the Client. The Parties will collaborate to resolve any issues, implement improvements, and ensure Client satisfaction.

## 34. DEPRECIATION OF EQUIPMENT & BUY-BACK OPTION (Optional)

## 35. CLIENT-SIDE MAINTENANCE

35.1 **Surrounding Conditions**: The Client is responsible for keeping the lawn or property conditions suitable (e.g., removing large debris, filling holes) so the Equipment can function without undue strain.

35.2 **Initial Grass Height**: Mowers are designed for regular maintenance, not heavy initial cutting of tall grass. The Client should ensure lawn conditions are at a manageable height before the first operation.
