Additional Gross Profit: $12,000 Ã— 60% Ã— 60% = $4,320
Additional Costs:      $1,000 (territory support)
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Net Impact:           +$3,320/month

Projected Cash Flow:  -$3,500 + $3,320 = -$180/month
```

### **4th Territory Impact** 
```
Net Impact from 4th:  +$3,320/month
Projected Cash Flow:  -$180 + $3,320 = +$3,140/month âœ… PROFITABLE
