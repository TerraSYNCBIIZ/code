## ðŸš¨ **RED FLAGS TO WATCH**

1. **If additional services can't justify $12K/territory** â†’ Model needs major revision
2. **If market size is smaller than assumed** â†’ Growth timeline unrealistic  
3. **If costs are higher than modeled** â†’ Breakeven pushed out
4. **If competition is fierce** â†’ Revenue assumptions too optimistic

## ðŸ“ž **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Review the `DATA_COLLECTION_TEMPLATE.md` file**
2. **Start with the additional services breakdown** (most critical)
3. **Spend 2-3 hours this week on market research**  
4. **Let me know when you have data to input**

**Remember**: It's better to have a conservative, validated model than an optimistic, unvalidated one. Investors appreciate honesty and thoroughness.
