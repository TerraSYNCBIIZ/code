# Pink Apron - Master Restructuring Strategy
**Date:** August 3, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Wesley Pitts  
**Classification:** Internal Strategy Document

---

## Strategic Context

### Current Business State
- Started spring 2024, unstable revenue model
- 3 equal partners (25% each) = decision paralysis
- Planned: 10% equity allocation to Jan (bringing everyone to 25% equal)
- Limited coffee shop contracts, minimal corporate clients
- Jan (contractor) handles operations, has Performance Food Group relationship
- **Hidden Asset:** $180k+ annual PFG opportunity (confidential until equity locked)

### Partner Availability Reality
- **Wesley:** Full-time local commitment, strategic leadership
- **Jan:** Operations expertise, PFG relationship, ready for partnership
- **Zach:** Moving to Nashville, running logistics company (part-time availability)
- **Grant:** Final year college → Houston oil career (minimal availability)

### Strategic Leverage
- Wesley + Jan control operational execution
- PFG relationship secured through Jan
- Current partners unaware of PFG opportunity size
- No formal legal agreements in place (easy restructuring)

## Two-Path Negotiation Strategy

### Path A: Performance-Based Vesting with Tax Optimization (Primary Option)
**Vesting Structure:**
- **All partners start at 0% ownership**
- Company owns 100% initially
- Partners receive restricted stock that vests to 25% each over 4-5 years
- **83(b) elections filed immediately** to lock in minimal current valuation
- **Performance-based vesting:** Must meet goals to earn equity

**Tax Benefits:**
- Pay taxes on current minimal valuation vs. future high valuation
- All future appreciation becomes capital gains (not ordinary income)
- Potential Section 1202 QSBS benefits ($10M tax-free per partner)

**Leadership Rules:**
1. **Wesley has final decision-making authority** on all matters
2. **Performance requirements:** Each partner must execute their role to vest equity
3. **Forfeiture mechanism:** Non-performance = equity forfeiture and redistribution

**Message:** *"Everyone can earn equal equity through performance, with massive tax advantages through proper structure."*

### Path B: Contribution-Based Equity (Fallback Option)
**Equity Structure:**
- Wesley: 40% (CEO, full-time commitment)
- Jan: 40% (COO, operations + PFG relationship)
- Zach: 10% (part-time logistics advisor)
- Grant: 10% (part-time financial advisor)

**Message:** *"If you can't commit to full role ownership, equity should match contribution levels."*

## Information Control Strategy

### Phase 1: Secure Role/Equity Agreement (Days 1-7)
**Messaging:**
- "We have significant growth opportunities that require professional structure"
- "Everyone can earn substantial equity by fully owning critical functions"
- Present both Path A and Path B options
- **Do NOT reveal PFG specifics yet**

### Phase 2: PFG Revelation (After equity locked)
**Timing:** Only after written agreement on roles and equity
**Message:** *"The specific opportunity is $180k+ annual with Performance Food Group. This validates why we needed these role structures. Your equity stakes are in a business with immediate major revenue."*

---

## Negotiation Scripts

### Opening Group Meeting
*"I called this meeting because we've reached a decision point. We have significant growth opportunities, but our current structure won't let us execute. I'm proposing we professionalize the business with clear roles and equity that matches contribution."*

**Present Two Options:**

**Option A - Advisory Roles:**
*"If you want limited involvement, you can take 10% equity each for part-time advisory roles. No major commitments required."*

**Option B - Ownership Roles:**
*"If you want to be true partners, you can earn 15% by fully owning critical business functions. But this requires real commitment and performance standards."*

### Individual Conversations

**To Zach:**
*"You have two choices: Keep your 25% equity by fully owning our entire distribution operation. That means you own the PFG relationship completely - all their communications go through you, you work to expand our business within PFG, and you're actively bringing on 2-3 new major distributors each year. Or take 10% for part-time advisory work. Full ownership means full accountability to me."*

**To Grant:**
*"Same deal: Keep 25% by becoming our full CFO and financial decision-maker. You own all our accounting, you're finding every tax advantage possible, and you're making financial recommendations on major decisions. This could save us tens of thousands in taxes and optimize our financial structure. Or take 10% for occasional input. But 25% means you're fully accountable for our financial management."*

### Objection Handling

**"This seems like you're taking control"**
→ *"I'm offering you the chance to own significant business functions. If you perform, you get rewarded. If you don't want the responsibility, advisory roles are available."*

**"Why should you be the final decision maker?"**
→ *"Because I'm the only one staying local full-time and taking ultimate responsibility for results. You keep equal equity, but someone has to be accountable for final decisions."*

**"What if we just keep things as they are?"**
→ *"That's not an option. Jan and I are moving forward with growth opportunities. You can participate at these levels or we'll do it without you."*

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### If Partners Reject Both Paths
**Plan B:** Wesley + Jan form new entity
- Secure PFG contract under new company
- Buy out existing Pink Apron assets at current valuation
- Start fresh with 50/50 partnership

### If Partners Choose Path A (Advisory)
- Lower risk, predictable structure
- Wesley + Jan maintain operational control
- Faster decision-making with 80% control

### If Partners Choose Path B (Ownership)
- Higher potential value for all parties
- Requires performance monitoring systems
- Risk of role performance failures

---

## Success Metrics

### 90-Day Targets
- Legal structure completed
- All partners performing in assigned roles
- PFG contract generating revenue
- Clear path to Year 1 $180k target

### Annual Goals
- Revenue targets achieved
- All role owners meeting performance metrics
- Operational efficiency optimized
- Growth pipeline developed for Year 2

---

## Key Decision Points

### For Wesley:
- Which path offers better long-term control and growth?
- Risk tolerance for partner performance in critical roles?
- Preference for operational simplicity vs. maximum partnership value?

### Strategic Recommendation:
**Start with Path B** - offer the opportunity for higher equity through role ownership. If they decline or underperform, default to Path A structure. This approach:
- Tests their true commitment level
- Maximizes business function coverage if they accept
- Provides clear fallback option
- Demonstrates generous leadership while maintaining control

**Next Action:** Schedule individual conversations within 48 hours to present both path options and gauge interest levels.
