## Proposed Restructuring Strategy

### Core Structure: Performance-Based Vesting with 83(b) Tax Optimization

#### Primary Approach: 0% Initial Ownership with Vesting Schedule
**Initial Ownership Structure:**
- **All Partners Start at 0% Ownership**
- **Company owns 100% initially**
- Partners receive restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting
- **Equal 25% potential equity** for each partner (Wesley, Jan, Zach, Grant)

**Vesting Schedule:**
- **Year 1:** 0% vested (performance evaluation period)
- **Year 2:** 25% vests upon meeting performance milestones
- **Year 3:** 50% cumulative vesting
- **Year 4:** 75% cumulative vesting  
- **Year 5:** 100% fully vested

**Tax Optimization Strategy:**
- **83(b) Elections filed immediately** (within 30 days of stock issuance)
- Partners pay ordinary income tax on current minimal valuation
- **All future appreciation becomes capital gains**
- Potential **Section 1202 QSBS benefits** (up to $10M tax-free per partner)

#### Fallback Option: Traditional Equity Split
- Wesley: 40%, Jan: 40%, Zach: 10%, Grant: 10%
- If partners won't accept performance-based structure
