# Pitch Deck Simplicity Guidelines

Follow the Guy Kawasaki and Steve Jobs philosophy for all pitch deck slides:

## Core Principles
- **One key message per slide** - If you can't explain it in 10 words, it's too complex
- **Visual over text** - Use images, icons, and graphics instead of paragraphs
- **Big, bold statements** - Make text large enough to read from the back of the room
- **Minimal bullet points** - Maximum 3 points per slide, preferably fewer
- **White space is your friend** - Don't fill every pixel

## Text Guidelines
- Headlines: 1-5 words maximum
- Body text: 1-2 short sentences maximum
- Remove all unnecessary words
- Use active voice, present tense
- Make every word count

## Visual Guidelines
- Include image placeholders when actual images aren't available
- Use icons to represent concepts
- Make graphics 2x larger than you think necessary
- Consistent color scheme (green accents for TerraSync)
- Clean, professional layouts with plenty of breathing room

## Slide Structure
- Title (big and bold)
- 1-3 key points (visual + minimal text)
- Call to action or key takeaway (if needed)

Remember: The slide should tell the story even if you weren't there to present it.
