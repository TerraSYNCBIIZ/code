# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive dynamic cost modeling system that accurately calculates and scales operational costs, customer acquisition costs, and employee costs based on business growth metrics. The system will provide realistic cost projections that adjust automatically as the company expands across locations, customers, and revenue, enabling more accurate financial planning and decision-making.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial planner, I want dynamic employee cost modeling that scales with business growth, so that I can accurately project staffing expenses as we expand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating employee costs THEN the system SHALL determine headcount requirements based on locations and total acreage managed
2. WHEN projecting headcount THEN the system SHALL use realistic ratios of employees per location and acres per employee
3. WHEN calculating salary costs THEN the system SHALL include base salaries, benefits, payroll taxes, and insurance costs
4. WHEN headcount increases THEN the system SHALL apply step-function scaling for management overhead costs
5. WHEN calculating employee costs THEN the system SHALL account for regional salary variations based on location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want comprehensive operational cost modeling that scales with business expansion, so that I can understand true operational expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating facility costs THEN the system SHALL include lease/rent costs that scale with number of locations
2. WHEN calculating equipment costs THEN the system SHALL include purchase, financing, maintenance, and replacement reserves
3. WHEN calculating vehicle costs THEN the system SHALL include financing, fuel, maintenance, and insurance per vehicle
4. WHEN calculating utility costs THEN the system SHALL scale based on facility size and equipment usage
5. WHEN calculating insurance costs THEN the system SHALL include general liability, professional, vehicle, and property insurance
6. WHEN calculating compliance costs THEN the system SHALL include licensing, permits, and regulatory requirements per location

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a marketing director, I want accurate customer acquisition cost modeling that includes all acquisition channels, so that I can optimize marketing spend and understand true CAC.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL include digital marketing spend (Google Ads, Facebook, SEO tools)
2. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL include sales team costs (salaries, commissions, tools, travel)
3. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL include lead generation costs (events, partnerships, referral programs)
4. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL include onboarding and setup costs per new customer
5. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL include marketing technology stack costs (CRM, automation, analytics)
6. WHEN calculating CAC THEN the system SHALL account for conversion rates at each stage of the funnel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want cost scaling models that reflect realistic business growth patterns, so that projections remain accurate at different company sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN costs reach scaling thresholds THEN the system SHALL apply step-function increases for management and infrastructure
2. WHEN calculating per-unit costs THEN the system SHALL apply efficiency scaling where economies of scale reduce unit costs
3. WHEN projecting costs THEN the system SHALL use linear scaling for variable costs that grow directly with customers
4. WHEN calculating overhead THEN the system SHALL distribute fixed costs across growing customer base
5. WHEN scaling costs THEN the system SHALL account for geographic expansion complexity and regional cost variations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CFO, I want detailed cost breakdowns and scenario analysis, so that I can understand cost drivers and plan for different growth scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cost projections THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns by cost category and time period
2. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL show cost per customer, cost per location, and cost per acre metrics
3. WHEN projecting scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide conservative, realistic, and aggressive growth cost models
4. WHEN costs change THEN the system SHALL highlight which factors are driving cost increases or decreases
5. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL show cost efficiency trends and identify optimization opportunities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want real-time cost adjustments based on actual business metrics, so that projections stay aligned with reality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business metrics change THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate all dependent cost projections
2. WHEN updating assumptions THEN the system SHALL propagate changes through all related cost calculations
3. WHEN actual costs differ from projections THEN the system SHALL provide variance analysis and adjustment recommendations
4. WHEN viewing projections THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which costs are fixed, variable, or semi-variable
5. WHEN costs are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of changes and assumptions used
